# FLARE21-EfficientSCN
Our implementation used for the [MICCAI 2021 FLARE Challenge](https://flare.grand-challenge.org/) titled **Efficient Multi-Organ Segmentation Using SpatialConfiguartion-Net with Low GPU Memory Requirements**.

You need to have the [MedicalDataAugmentationTool](https://github.com/christianpayer/MedicalDataAugmentationTool) framework by [Christian Payer](https://github.com/christianpayer) downloaded and in your PYTHONPATH for the scripts to work.

If you have questions about the code, write me a [mail](mailto:franz.thaler@icg.tugraz.at).

A description on the installation and usage will be added soon.
